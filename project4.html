          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>This project is a snake game that is built with HTML, CSS,
               and JavaScript in Visual Studio Code. </p>
          
          <p>To start the game the user tap on the arrow keys to move the snake</p>

          <p>The snake will automatically move in the direction it is 
              facing when the game starts</p>

          <p>The user can move the snake left or right using the left 
              or right button in the keyboard</p>

          <p>The user can move the snake up or down using the up 
              or down button in the keyboard</p>

          <p>When the snake eats the food, the food will add itself to the snake
               and the score will increase by 1 point</p>

          <p>When the snake eats the poison the snake will decrease back to one 
              block and the score will revert back to zero, 
              forcing the user to start the game again.
          </p>

          <p>The poisons will disappear and reappear randomly on the screen</p>

          <p>The snake is able to stop its movement by being placed on the ends of the screen 
              where there is no poison or food present</p>
