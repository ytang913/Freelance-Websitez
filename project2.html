          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
              Many students and faculty coming to the University of Maryland, College Park
              are unfamilar with PG County. On top of the many stresses of being 
              in an academic environment, finding the nearest PG County Agency to 
              solve their problems can be a daunting task. 
          </p>                    
          <p>
              To solve this problem I created the PGC Agency Finder which 
              is essentially a full stack web application that is used 
              to look up PG County Government Agencies. 
          </p>
          <p>
              The application works by entering the agency of interest, which
              results in a list being populated with the desired agencies.</p> 
              
          <p>The list itself will display the name of the office,its address,
              and its agency. </p>

          <p>There is also a map function, which will display 
              the location of each populated agency with the accompanying information 
              in a pop-up banner. </p>

          <p>Furthermore, the "Get All Offices" button can be used 
              to get all agencies on the map and in the list.</p>

          <p>Possble agencies users 
              can enter are HEALTH, DPWT, COURTS, OCS, SOIL CONSERVATION, 
              FIRE, PSC, DER, POLICE, SHERIFF, COUNTY EXECUTIVE, OHRM, and OIT.</p>
          </p>

          <h2>Documentation</h2>
          <p>
              This web application was done using 
              HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs, JSON file, Leaflet, Express, and Node.Js.
          </p>    
          
          <p>
              I used HTML and CSS for the overall design of the frontend portion of the web application. 
              JavaScript for the user interactions with the web application.
          </p>

          <p>
              Leaflet was used for the map creation based on the Open Street Map API.
          </p>
          <p>
              Express/Node.Js was used for the backend part of the website, 
              essentially storing the data from the PG County API.
          </p>
          
          <p>
              All end points are expecting a JSON object/form object with the key agency and an agency bound to that key. 
              Only end point that does not rely on the input is the GET route.
          </p>

          <p>
              Example of JSON object: { agency: 'FIRE' } will cause endpoints to read the agency as FIRE. 
          </p>

          <p>The key must be 'agency' as the Value is not case sensitive.
              Any case variation will still be read as FIRE.</p>
          <p>
              GET is used to get all offices and return that to the list and map. 
              It returns all offices in a JSON object unfiltered.
          </p>
          <p>
              PUT is used to populate the list of offices with offices of interest based on agency. 
              It returns a filtered JSON object with office: description, address, city, agency.
          </p>
          
          <p>
              POST is used to get all offices of interest and return information needed to generate map points. Returns a filtered JSON object with office: description, address, city, agency, longitude, latitude. 
              It includes longitude and lattidude in which PUT does not.
          </p>

          <p>
              The data of the different agencies came from the  
              <a href = "https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/">PG County API</a>
          </p>

          <p>The web application was deployed on 
               <a href ="https://pgcagencyfinder.azurewebsites.net/">Microsoft Azure Cloud</a>
          </p>
